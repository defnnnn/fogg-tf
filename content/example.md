Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. All
I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could
possibly go wrong? I am the last of my species, and I know how that
weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. You
hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! __Kill me!__ *KILL ME!* I'm
nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time
you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

## I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do
you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you
basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? I'm nobody's
taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel
like jumping out of a spaceship.

1. They're not aliens, they're Earthâ€¦liens!
2. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What
   could possibly go wrong?
3. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!
